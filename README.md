# TAO-MTP in a Dynamic Environment

TAO-MTP stands for Tracking Automatic Optimization - Moving Target Pursuit Algorithm. 

This project built on ideas presented in the following publication:
> M. Xu, Z. Pan, H. Lu, Y. Ye, P. Lv and A. El Rhalibi, "Moving-Target Pursuit Algorithm Using Improved Tracking Strategy," in IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 27-39, March 2010, doi: 10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2042449.

The repository is a Visual Studio Solution containing project files that implements an enchancement to the TAO-MTP path finding algorithm using C# and the XNA game development framework. 

The enhacement accommodates dynamic objects in the game environment and shows how the algorithm can be used by an AI game character to efficiently follow the player while avoiding static and moving obstacles in the game environment.

This was originally developed as the final year project to obtain my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science & Engineering.

A simpler javascript implementation can be in [html-games-repo](https://github.com/abinand/html-games)
